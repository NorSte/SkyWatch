## SkyWatch

SkyWatch is a real-time flight tracking application developed as part of the IN2000 course. It collects live aircraft data and displays dynamic flight movements on an interactive map, allowing users to explore, monitor, and analyze ongoing air traffic in Scandinavia. In addition to flight tracking, SkyWatch provides detailed information about airports, including arrivals, departures, and local weather forecasts.
